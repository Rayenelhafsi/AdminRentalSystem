# RentalAdminSystem
I'm delighted to share my first project with C++ where i used xlnt library to finish my program for renting agency.
Thus the owner will be able to have database (excel sheet) for his all homes , he can read his data , add delete update his homes'data and he also can search for his homes for certain criterias like number of rooms distance from the sea ect 
YOU SHOULD CLONE CORRECTLY THE XLNT LIBRARY AND INSTALL DEPENDENCIES BEFORE STARTING THE PROGRAM 
CONTACT ME FOR THAT ;)
